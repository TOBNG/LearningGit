On that day, tob suddenly thought of that he began to learn git long long ago, however the fact is that after a whole year he got no progress and put himself all in MOYU.

It seems that tob had already learnt something about remote repo but now he knows nothing about git. (How did I named such a strange name of branch like bcr???)
